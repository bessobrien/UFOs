# UFOs Analysis with Javascript

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We have created this webpage with javascript filters and css styling.

## Results

When opening the index file in the browser, you can see the filter area down to the left:
![filter_location](https://github.com/bessobrien/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filter_location.png)

By entering the values you want to use to narrow down your search, you can find a smaller view of the UFO data you are looking for.

As you can see, when you enter your variables and hit enter, you can see the data update in the table to the right:
![filtered](https://github.com/bessobrien/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filtered.png)

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that it is not updated with the most recent data or 'live' updates.

Two recommendations for further development of this webpage:

1. Find a solution for current data or live data in order to ensure the most recent sightings are included.
2. Add a 'reset' option or button. This would add a more user-friendly experience - the user would be able to understand that the data has been reset, and they can do a totally different search from the beginning.
